#Flash memory abstraction layer for recording looper tracks to an on-board memory chip
#Copyright 2020 Thomas TEMPE

# Limitations of W25Q128:
# * each write operation can only write within a 256-byte page (address ends with 0x00).
# * need to erase (in min 4kB blocks) before writing
# * writing and erasing can take a long time (up to a minute)

#Strategy:
# * Allocate fixed block for each looper track.
# * erase a the memory immediately (in sequence, through self.loop()) when a loop is deleted
# * check the status before reading, and suspend the write if needed
# * block a user action that may cause a 2nd write in the UI for as long as the previous one is not finished
# * record the loop status in the UC flash memory before starting to erase, and after finishing recording
# * on startup, check that each erased loops are successfully erased
# * Buffer write operations to a local buffer. Try writing as soon as possible.
# * Check for BUSY status before accepting to start recording a loop.
# * Buffer the last read operations of one Midi command. If more is needed, suspend/resume the write operation, and perform a single read, to avoid disruption to the real-time playback.

#Open loopholes:
# * if you finish recording a loop, but the last Write operation (3ms max) did not finish before power loss, the end of the loop could be corrupted.

#TODO:
# * display write/erase or erase_whole_chip status on the screen
# * count the number of "read status" operations per cycle; add a test to only check every 40 ms?
# * handle all exceptions raised below
